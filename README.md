This is an example of an implementation of the quadruple precision through JNI using the GCC quadmath library.

You should change the path in the "System.load" to your .dll (if you use Windows) in case "System.loadLibrary( "quadp" );" not work.

IMPORTANT: no test has been done yet. Use it at your own risk.
